An e-commerce application is built with multiple payment gateway integrations and customized plugins addons. It uses **Typescript**, **React** amd **Next.js**. It uses **Tailwind CSS** and **RadixUI** for CSS usage. It uses **redux** to do the state management. For fetching and payment, **axios** and **strapi** are implemented. **MongoDB** is used for data storage.

### Adding a New Payment Method

To add a new payment method, follow these steps:

1. **Create Payment Method Class:**
   - Create a new class for the payment method, extending the `PaymentMethod` base class.

2. **Implement Payment Logic:**
   - Implement the necessary methods such as `authenticate`, `validate`, `charge`, etc., according to the requirements of the new payment method.

3. **Configure Payment Method:**
   - Add configuration settings for the new payment method in the `paymentMethods.json` file.

4. **Instantiate Payment Method:**
   - Use the `PaymentMethodFactory` to instantiate the new payment method with the appropriate configuration.

5. **Integrate with UI:**
   - Update the UI to include an option for the new payment method and handle its selection.

For detailed examples and best practices, refer to the existing payment method implementations (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`).
